 BACKGROUND:

 The following schema is a subset of a relational database of a grocery store
 chain. This chain sells many products of different product classes to its
 customers across its different stores. It also conducts many different
 promotion campaigns.
 The relationship between the four tables we want to analyze is depicted below:

       # sales                                # products

 PROMPT:
 -- What are the top five (ranked in decreasing order)
 -- single-channel media types that correspond to the most money
 -- the grocery chain had spent on its promotional campaigns?

 Single Media Channel Types are promotions that contain only one media type.

 EXPECTED OUPTUT:
 Note: Please use the column name(s) specified in the expected output in your solution.
 +---------------------------+------------+
 | single_channel_media_type | total_cost |
 +---------------------------+------------+
 | In-Store Coupon           | 70800.0000 |
